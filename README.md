### Steps to Initialize Express.js Server

1.  **Install Express.js**: Ensure you have Node.js installed on your system. If not, download and install it from [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/). Then, install Express.js globally or locally within your project by running:

    `npm install express`

2.  **Create Server File**: Create a JavaScript file (e.g., `server.js`) in your project directory.
3.  **Server Setup**: Within `server.js`, import Express.js and create an instance of the Express application:


    `const express = require('express'); const app = express();`

4.  **Define Routes**: Define routes using the HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.) to handle client requests. For example:

    `app.get('/', (req, res) => {   res.send('Hello World!'); });`

5.  **Start Server**: Specify the port number to listen on and start the server:


    ``const port = 3000; // Choose your desired port app.listen(port, () => {   console.log(`Server is running on port ${port}`); });``


### Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully initialized an Express.js server within your project. This setup allows you to handle HTTP requests and build powerful web applications using Express.js.
